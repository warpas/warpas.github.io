<**EDITING PASS up to here**>

My posts didn’t appear on a fixed schedule up to this point. There was close to a week between the first post and the second one. Then a bit over 2 weeks before the third one. Then the fourth one dropped 9 weeks after that. What’s up with that?

I published the first post over **3 months ago**. Over that time I got better at understanding my own process. With that in mind I’d like to answer the question from the title - “When will you publish the next post?“

The short answer is - There won’t be a fixed schedule for now. I have been writing every day, in my spare time and when I have written something I consider worth your while, then it’ll get published.

If you’re interested in a my reasoning behind this answer, then you’re welcome to read on and explore the topic of writing and publishing with me. 😇

### Rose-tinted glasses 🤩

<**great spot for an image**>

I hoped to publish one post every week. I quickly found it to be impossible given the amount of time I dedicate to writing.

I enjoy watching Yahtzee Croshaw’s work. That guy keeps a weekly or bi-weekly schedule for his videos. He’s been remarkably consistent about it. His flagship game review series called “Zero Punctuation” has been running for 13 years now with very few breaks. I’m inspired by that but I didn’t want to commit to a similar amount of output initially. I was afraid I wouldn’t be able to post that often. My writing was inconsistent and I didn’t want to make a promise I couldn’t keep.

### Minimum Viable Post 💡

Without a schedule there is not clear end to writing and editing. A schedule could be a useful tool for me to fight perfectionist tendencies. They’re rampant among creatine types. Luckily I never considered myself to be creative. In web development there’s a seemingly ubiquitous concept of cutting project scope to reach a Minimum Viable Product. How do you understand a MVP blog post?

<**great spot for an image**>

What does a post need to have to be good? Please take 3 seconds to think about that before reading on…

My definition of a good MVP comes down to:
1. An interesting topic
2. Writing of high quality - clear & concise

<**Insert a mention of consistent effort**>
<**Insert a segue into the next section**>

- - - -
-<How to get to the following 3 points?>-

-1. Picking interesting topics instead of easy topics-
-2. High quality without falling for perfectionism-
-3. Consistent effort, not consistent results-

-Each of these helps me understand and solve the problems I identified over time.  Let’s dive in deeper.-
- - - -

### Keeping a schedule 📅 vs tackling interesting topics 🔎

I would like to write about topics I know enough about to be useful for you, the readers. I also want to feel strongly enough about a topic to be excited about pushing it past the finish line. The clear candidates for my post are the topics:
* I feel passionate about
* I struggled with and found a solution for
* Have made significant positive impact on my life

These categories make writing first draft easy for me. Sometimes the result is good enough to publish, most other times it needs editing. The first two topics I’ve taken to write about took 2-3 hours each . Other posts take up to 15 hours and 6 editing passes spread across 3 months of writing, stewing, splitting, editing and rewriting. And if Tim Urban’s “[Wait but why](https://waitbutwhy.com/)” is any indication, [some topics require years of writing](https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/08/story-of-us.html).  Sometimes the result ends up being too wordy, other times my thoughts are all over the place and I realise I stumbled into an intersection of 4-5 different topics. The latter situation is a clear direction that tells me “there’s something in that area worth exploring”. If I had a weekly or bi-weekly schedule, acting on that urge to follow these topics wouldn’t be feasible to me.

<**great spot for an image - forest of all knowledge**>

I wanted to embrace both easy and difficult topics, and that’s a big part of the reason why there won’t be a consistent posting schedule for now. Without that schedule the lure of perfectionism will be strong.

### The more time, the better post. Right? 🤔

I’ve decided to publish a post as soon as it’s ready. Answering what “ready” means is a bit more tricky. “High quality” and “pleasant readability” are even less clear. Those nebulous terms invite procrastination.

Writing the first draft is usually easy.  But once that’s done, the editing stage is up ahead. There’s a well known quote in the writing world:

> “If I had more time I would have written a shorter letter”

Editing takes the longest amount of time during the writing process. It’s also open-ended - there is no natural upper limit to the time you could spend rereading and editing a post, other than the heat death of the universe or your own departure from this world. The door’s left ajar, letting perfectionism creep in.

<**great spot for an image**>

Creators hope their work will only get better the more time they spend on it. That post / book / painting / movie / game you’re working on can be excellent right now, but it will definitely be better, if you spend 2 more years on it. In reality the longer you spend on your work without focusing on the goal of releasing it, the less likely it is to ever come out. Or it will come out as jumbled, unfocused mess. I call it the “[Duke Nukem Forever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf-NmzJFEn0)” syndrome.

One solution, that could be helpful in trying to avoid the abyss of endless refinement, is setting a release date or a schedule. I already said why I won’t do that now. Another approach would be to put a limit on the number editing passes.

A post could always be made better, but I want it to, at the very least, be clear, concise and enjoyable to read. Once those three criteria are met, I will publish it. My current process of quality control, after the first draft is ready, consists of reading the post 2-3 times and doing an editing pass after each reading.

Once these editing passes are done and I’m still not happy with the result, I send the post to a narrow circle of readers, who have different sensibilities. I take their feedback into account and do a new set of 2-3 editing passes. At the end of that process the post is done and it will be published. Granted, the result relies heavily on my feels as an internal compass.

The process works for now and I'll improve it along the way when it needs improvement. The key here is to keep some type of consistency. That’s where the last area comes in.

### Consistent effort 💪 vs consistent results 📚

Another way to look at a schedule is to deliver results consistently. And my current writing output is anything but consistent. But I can control my input - how much time I spend writing and the effort I put into it.

On July 27th I’ve committed to writing every day. By focusing on effort I hope to solve the following problems:
* my scarce writing experience
* getting discouraged by the “blank page”

These two issues seem tightly coupled to me. The [pottery class parable](https://aliabdaal.com/pottery/) resonates with me as a way of thinking about this. The goal is to put in the work more frequently. Writing often will help me improve my abilities, at least to a point.  Once I’ve spent a few months writing, I’ll have a better set of tools in my tool belt to figure out publishing high quality posts more often.

I found that the most difficult obstacle for me to jump over was to actually start writing. Once I get into it, I can write for an hour or two without a hassle. A piece of advice that helped me tremendously in this area was to focus on “[2 crappy pages per day](https://tim.blog/2013/12/09/the-ugly-new-york-times-bestseller-the-creative-process-in-action/)”, courtesy of Tim Ferriss. I adjusted this rule because writing isn’t my full time occupation. My current version of it is to write 10 words per day. It's easy enough to trick myself into starting. I usually end up putting much more time into it. An example that steered me towards this solution was [IBM’s low sales quotas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwjZ99aNsa4) and the question “are you aiming low enough?”.

### In conclusion

I want to focus on writing daily about interesting topics. Most of this writing time will go to a limited number of editing passes. I’m doing this in my spare time and I don’t want to publish something I think is a waste of your time as a reader. I’m still enamoured with the idea of having some sort of a schedule. I definitely want to explore that in the future. But it means there won’t be a fixed schedule for now.

Finally, I’d like to make a few promises I know I can keep:
* I will write every day. There might be a single day missed every now and then, but it [won’t happen 2 days in a row](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfLHTLQZ5nc).
* Every post you’ll see appear on this blog will be thoroughly read many times to ensure it reads well. I will make them as clear and concise as I can manage.

I hope you enjoyed this dive into my thinking process on this. I hope it was helpful to you. Thank you for reading ❤️

_And no, I’m not shooting for a_ [Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/) _post length anytime soon._
