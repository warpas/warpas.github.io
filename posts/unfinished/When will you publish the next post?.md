<**EDITING PASS up to here**>

My posts don‚Äôt appear on a fixed schedule. There was close to a week between the first post and the second post. Then a bit over 2 weeks before the third post. Then the fourth post dropped 9 weeks after that. What‚Äôs up with that?

I published the first post over **3 months ago**. Over that time I got better at understanding my own process. Let‚Äôs take another look at the question from the title - ‚ÄúWhen will you publish the next post?‚Äú

The short answer is - There won‚Äôt be a fixed schedule for now. I have been writing every day, in my spare time and when I have written something I consider worth your while, then it‚Äôll get published.

If you‚Äôre interested in a longer answer, then I‚Äôd like to welcome you to explore the topic of writing and publishing posts with me. üòá

### The original intent ü§©

I hoped to publish one post every week. I see the value in predicable posting schedule. But I didn‚Äôt want to commit to a schedule initially. I didn‚Äôt want to post low quality work just because I promised ‚Äúsomething‚Äù each week. My writing was inconsistent and I didn‚Äôt want to make a promise I couldn‚Äôt keep.

There‚Äôs clearly a conflict between consistent schedule and perfectionism. I‚Äôm aware perfectionist tendencies are running rampant among creatine types. Luckily I never considered myself to be creative. In web development there‚Äôs a seemingly ubiquitous concept of cutting project scope to reach a Minimum Viable Product. How do you understand MVP blog post?

My definition comes down to balancing three main areas:
1. Picking interesting topics instead of easy topics
2. High quality without falling for perfectionism
3. Consistent effort, not consistent results

Each of these helps me understand and solve the problems I identified over time.  Let‚Äôs dive in deeper.

### Interesting topics üîé vs easy topics üì∞

I would like to write about topics I know enough about to be useful for you, the readers. I also want to feel strongly enough about a topic to push it past the finish line. The clear candidates for my post the topics:
* I feel passionate about
* I struggled with and managed to find a solution for

Both of these categories make writing first draft easy for me. Sometimes the first draft is good enough to publish, other times it needs editing. The first two topics I‚Äôve taken to write about took 2-3 hours . Other posts take 15 hours and 6 editing passes spread across 3 months of writing, stewing, splitting, editing and rewriting. And if Tim Urban‚Äôs ‚Äú[Wait but why](https://waitbutwhy.com/)‚Äù is any indication, [some topics require years of writing](https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/08/story-of-us.html).  Sometimes the result ends up being too wordy, other times my thoughts are all over the place and I realise I stumbled into an intersection of 4-5 different topics. The latter situation is a clear direction that tells me ‚Äúthere‚Äôs something in that area worth exploring‚Äù. If I had a weekly or bi-weekly schedule, following that urge to explore these topics wouldn‚Äôt be feasible to me.

I wanted to embrace both easy and difficult topics, and that‚Äôs a big part of the reason why there won‚Äôt be a consistent posting schedule for now. Without that schedule the lure of perfectionism will be strong. That‚Äôs why I want to consciously balance the next area.

### High quality üéÅ vs Perfectionism üíñ

I‚Äôve decided to publish a post as soon as it‚Äôs ready. Answering what ‚Äúready‚Äù means is a bit more tricky. ‚ÄúHigh quality‚Äù and ‚Äúpleasant readability‚Äù are even less clear. Those nebulous terms invite procrastination. Writing the first draft is usually easy.  But once that‚Äôs done, I enter the editing stage.

Editing takes the longest amount of time during the writing process. It‚Äôs also open-ended - there is no natural upper limit to the time you could spend rereading and editing a post, other than the heat death of the universe or your own departure from this world. The door‚Äôs left ajar, letting perfectionism creep in. There‚Äôs a well known quote in the writing world:

> ‚ÄúIf I had more time I would have written a shorter letter‚Äù

That post / book / movie / game you‚Äôre working on can be excellent right now, but it will definitely be better, if you spend 2 more years on it. I call it the ‚ÄúDuke Nukem Forever‚Äù syndrome.

One solution, that could be helpful in trying to avoid the abyss of endless refinement, is setting a release date or a schedule. I already said why I won‚Äôt do that now. Another approach would be to put a limit on the number editing passes. Problems I hope to solve by doing that:
* publishing low quality posts
* keeping perfectionism at bay
* long times between posts

A post could always be made better, but I want it to, at the very least, be clear and enjoyable to read. Once those two criteria are met, I will publish it. My current process of quality control after the post is written consists of reading the post 2-3 times after writing it and doing an editing pass after these readings. Granted, it relies heavily on my feels as an internal compass.

Once these 2-3 editing passes are done and I‚Äôm still not happy with the result, I send the post to a narrow circle of readers, who have different sensibilities. I take their feedback into account and do a new set of 2-3 editing passes. At the end of that process the post is done and it will be published.

The process works for now and I'll improve it along the way when it needs improvement. The key here is to keep some type of consistency. That‚Äôs where the last area comes in.

### Consistent effort üí™ vs consistent results üìö

I enjoy watching Yahtzee Croshaw‚Äôs work. That guy keeps a weekly or bi-weekly schedule for his videos. He‚Äôs been remarkably consistent about it. His flagship game review series called ‚ÄúZero Punctuation‚Äù has been running for 13 years now with very few breaks. I‚Äôm inspired by that, and I would definitely want to explore that kind of schedule in the future. A post every week is a good goal to aim for. A schedule could be a useful tool for me to keep perfectionism at bay.

Another way to look at a schedule is to deliver results consistently. And my current writing output is anything but consistent. But I can control my input - how much time I spend writing and the effort I put into it.

On July 27th I‚Äôve committed to writing every day. By focusing on effort I hope to solve the following problems:
* my scarce writing experience
* getting discouraged by the ‚Äúblank page‚Äù

These two issues seem tightly coupled to me. The [pottery class parable](https://aliabdaal.com/pottery/) resonates with me as a way of thinking about this. The goal is to put in the work more frequently. Writing often will improve my abilities, at least to a point.  Once I‚Äôve spent a few months writing, I‚Äôll have better tools in my tool belt to figure out publishing good quality posts more often.

I found that the most difficult obstacle for me to jump over was to actually start writing. Once I get into it, I can write for an hour or two without a hassle. A piece of advice that helped me tremendously in this area was to focus on ‚Äú[2 crappy pages per day](https://tim.blog/2013/12/09/the-ugly-new-york-times-bestseller-the-creative-process-in-action/)‚Äù, courtesy of Tim Ferriss. I adjusted this rule because writing isn‚Äôt my full time occupation. My current version is to write 10 words per day. It's easy enough to trick myself into starting. I usually end up putting much more time into it. An example that steered me towards this solution was [IBM‚Äôs low sales quotas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwjZ99aNsa4) and the question ‚Äúare you aiming low enough?‚Äù.

### Summary

There won‚Äôt be a fixed schedule for now. I will focus on interesting topics, high quality and writing every day. I‚Äôm still enamoured with the idea of a schedule to keep perfectionism at bay. I definitely want to explore that in the future. But first I want to have 6-12 months of daily writing experience under my belt. Focusing on consistent effort right now will be instrumental in helping me get it. I reserve the right to change my mind on the specifics, but the direction should be clear.

Let me reiterate - I‚Äôm doing this in my spare time.  I don‚Äôt want to publish something I think is a waste of your time as a reader, just to keep a schedule. So there won‚Äôt be ‚Äúa new post every Tuesday‚Äù or any other arbitrary schedule. When I have written something I consider worth your while, then it‚Äôll get published.

### I‚Äôve got a promise for you

Finally, I‚Äôd like to make a few promises I know I can keep:
* I will write every day. There might be a single day missed every now and then, but it [won‚Äôt happen 2 days in a row](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfLHTLQZ5nc).
* Every post you‚Äôll see appear on this blog will be thoroughly read many times to ensure it reads well and the quality will be as high as I can manage.
* I will fix all typos and language errors I can find. If you find any that I missed, please feel free to tell me.

I hope you enjoyed this dive into my thinking process on this. I hope it was helpful to you. Thank you for reading ‚ù§Ô∏è
