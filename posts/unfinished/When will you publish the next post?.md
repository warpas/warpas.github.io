<**EDITING PASS up to here**>

My posts don‚Äôt appear on a fixed schedule. There was close to a week between the first post and the second post. Then a bit over 2 weeks before the third post. Then the fourth post dropped 9 weeks after that. What‚Äôs up with that?

 I didn‚Äôt want to commit to a schedule initially. My writing was  inconsistent and I didn‚Äôt want to make a promise I couldn‚Äôt keep. I published the first post over **3 months ago**. Over that time I got better at understanding my own process. Let‚Äôs take another look at the question from the title - ‚ÄúWhen will you publish the next post?‚Äú

The short answer is - I‚Äôm writing every day, in my spare time and when I have written something I consider worth your while, then it‚Äôll get published.

If you‚Äôre interested in a longer answer, then I‚Äôd like to welcome you to explore with me the topic of writing and publishing posts. üòá

### The original intent ü§©

I hoped to publish one post every week. I see the value in predicable posting schedule. But I don‚Äôt want to post low quality work just because I promised ‚Äúsomething‚Äù each week.  There‚Äôs clearly a conflict between consistent schedule and perfectionism.

I'm aware perfectionist tendencies are running rampant among creatine types. Luckily I never considered myself to be creative. In web development there‚Äôs a seemingly ubiquitous concept of cutting project scope to reach a Minimum Viable Product. How do you understand MVP blog post? My definition comes down to  topic choice and high quality of writing. I decided there were three main areas I wanted to focus on:

1. Consistent effort, not consistent results
2. Picking interesting topics instead of easy topics
3. Posts of high quality without falling for perfectionism

Each of these was an attempt to understand or solve the problems I identified over time.  Let‚Äôs dive in deeper.

### Effort üí™ vs results üìö

I enjoy watching Yahtzee Croshaw‚Äôs work, and that guy keeps a weekly or bi-weekly schedule for his videos. He‚Äôs remarkably consistent about it too! His flagship game review series called ‚ÄúZero Punctuation‚Äù has been running for 13 years now with very few breaks. I‚Äôm inspired by that, and I would definitely want to explore that kind of schedule in the future. A post every week is a good goal to aim for in my opinion. A schedule could be a useful tool for me to keep perfectionism

Another way to look at a ‚Äúschedule‚Äù is to see it as ‚Äúconsistent results‚Äù. And my current writing output is anything but consistent. But I can control my input - how much time I spend writing and the effort I put into it.

On July 27th I‚Äôve committed to writing every day. By focusing on that consistent effort I hope to solve the following problems:
* my scarce experience in consistent writing
* getting discouraged by the ‚Äúblank page‚Äù

These two issues seem tightly coupled to me.  The [pottery class parable](https://aliabdaal.com/pottery/) resonates with me as a way of thinking about  this. The goal is to put in the work more frequently. Writing often will improve my abilities, at least to a point.  Once I‚Äôve spent a few months writing, I‚Äôll have more tools in my tool belt to figure out publishing good quality posts more often.

I found that starting writing is the most difficult obstacle for me to jump over. Once I get into it, I can write for an hour or two without a hassle. A piece of advice that helped me tremendously in this area was to focus on ‚Äú[2 crappy pages per day](https://tim.blog/2013/12/09/the-ugly-new-york-times-bestseller-the-creative-process-in-action/)‚Äù, courtesy of Tim Ferriss. Writing isn‚Äôt my full time occupation, so I adjusted it a bit, but the principles are the same. My current version is to write 10 words per day. It's easy enough to trick myself into starting. I usually end up putting much more time into it. An example that steered me towards this solution was [IBM‚Äôs low sales quotas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwjZ99aNsa4) and the question ‚Äúare you aiming low enough?‚Äù.

Potential problems/risks resulting from this solution:
* long times between posts

### Interesting topics üîé vs easy topics üì∞

I would like to write about topics I know enough about to be useful for you, the readers. I also want to feel strongly enough about a topic to push it past the finish line. It comes down to two types of topics:
* The ones I feel passionate about
* The ones I struggled with and managed to find a solution for

Both of these types of topics are easy for me to write the first draft.  I can write and publish a full post on them in about 2-3 hours. Those were the first topics I‚Äôve taken to write about on this blog. Other posts take 15 hours and 6 editing passes spread across 3 months of writing, stewing, splitting, editing and rewriting. And if Tim Urban‚Äôs ‚Äú[Wait but why](https://waitbutwhy.com/)‚Äù is any indication, [some topics require years of writing](https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/08/story-of-us.html).  Sometimes the result ends up being too wordy, other times my thoughts are all over the place and I realise I stumbled into an intersection of 4-5 different topics. The latter situation is fascinating to me. It‚Äôs a clear direction that tells me ‚Äúthere‚Äôs something in that area worth exploring‚Äù. If I had a weekly or bi-weekly schedule, following that urge to explore these topics wouldn‚Äôt be feasible to me. I wanted to embrace difficult topics, and that‚Äôs another part of the reason why there won‚Äôt be a posting schedule now.

Potential problems/risks resulting from this solution:
* the lure of perfectionism
* long times between posts

### High quality üéÅ vs Perfectionism üíñ

I‚Äôve decided to publish a post as soon as it‚Äôs ready. Answering what ‚Äúready‚Äù means is a bit more tricky. Pleasant readability is even more subjective. I write the outline in the first sitting. At that point I have a relatively good idea if the topic is worthy of a full post. Writing itself requires consistency. That's already described in the previous sections. My current process of quality control after the post is written consists of reading the post 2-3 times after writing it and doing an editing pass after these readings. Granted, it relies heavily on my feels. But it works for now and I'll improve it along the way.

 Problems I hope to solve:
* publishing low quality posts
* keeping perfectionism at bay

Editing takes more time than writing during the writing process. It‚Äôs also open-ended - there is no natural upper limit to the time you could spend rereading and editing a post, other than the heat death of the universe or your own departure from this world. The door‚Äôs left ajar, letting perfectionism creep in. There‚Äôs a well known quote in the writing world:

> ‚ÄúIf I had more time I would have written a shorter letter‚Äù

The post / book / movie / game can be excellent right now, but it will definitely be better, if we spend 2 more years on it. It‚Äôs what I call the Duke Nukem Forever syndrome.

One solution, that could be helpful in trying to avoid the abyss of endless refinement, is setting a release date or a schedule. I already said why I won‚Äôt do that now. But that would leave this problem unsolved. A post could always be made better, but I want it to, at the very least, be clear and enjoyable to read. Once those two criteria are met, I will publish it. What do these two goals mean?

I start a post off with a topic or a paragraph of thoughts that I consider interesting or worthwhile. After writing my first draft of what I wanted to say in the post, the first few editing passes are aiming to increase the clarity of the message. I want you to be able to easily tell what I‚Äôm saying, what‚Äôs the context and why I think it‚Äôs important. The second goal is for the post to feel good to read. I‚Äôve got a style I enjoy, and I try to write something so that my 10-years younger self would be excited to read it. I‚Äôm testing some of the paragraphs with a narrow circle of readers, who have different sensibilities, but the main goal is to write something I myself would enjoy reading. It helps me navigate through my internal compass.


### In conclusion

My guiding principles are:
1. Consistent effort, not consistent results
2. Picking interesting topics instead of easy topics
3. Posts of high quality without falling for perfectionism

All of these points seem to me to be at the opposite ends of the same spectrum. But if you look at it from another perspective, they point towards the same goal, but serve different functions. The consistent effort is a stabiliser. I want some writing done every day in order to get comfortable with the blank page and the process of writing. I want to move every day in the direction of publishing the next post. Those daily steps don‚Äôt have to be huge. But they need to be consistent.

I‚Äôm still enamoured with the idea of a schedule to keep perfectionism at bay. I definitely want to explore that in the future. But first I want to have 6-12 months of daily writing experience under my belt. Focusing on consistent effort right now will be instrumental in helping me get it. I reserve the right to change my mind on the specifics, but the direction should be clear.

Let me reiterate - I‚Äôm doing this in my spare time.  I don‚Äôt want to publish something I think is a waste of your time as a reader, just to keep a schedule. So there won‚Äôt be ‚Äúnew post every Tuesday‚Äù or any other arbitrary schedule. When I have written something I consider worth your while, then it‚Äôll get published. I hope you enjoyed this dive into my thinking process on this. I hope it was helpful to you.

### Promise

Finally, I‚Äôd like to make a few promises I know I can keep:
* I will write every day. There might be a single day missed every now and then, but it [won‚Äôt happen 2 days in a row](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfLHTLQZ5nc).
* Every post you‚Äôll see appear on this blog will be thoroughly read many times to ensure it reads well and the quality will be as high as I can manage.
* I will fix all typos and language errors I can find. If you find any that I missed, please feel free to tell me at [contact@warpas.blog](mailto:contact@warpas.blog) or in the comments (**when they‚Äôre available**).

Thank you for reading ‚ù§Ô∏è
