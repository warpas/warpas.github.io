My posts don‚Äôt appear on a fixed schedule. There was close to a week between the first post and the second post. Then a bit over 2 weeks before the third post. Then the fourth post dropped 9 weeks after. What‚Äôs up with that?

 I didn‚Äôt want to commit to a schedule initially. My writing was  inconsistent and I didn‚Äôt want to make a promise I couldn‚Äôt keep. I published the first post **3 months ago**. Now I‚Äôve got some ideas about how long writing a post can take. This post is my attempt at answering the following questions - ‚ÄúHow often are the new posts going to appear on this blog? When can I expect the next post? ‚Äù

The short answer is - I‚Äôm writing every day, in my spare time and when I have written something I consider worth your while, then it‚Äôll get published.

If you‚Äôre interested in a longer answer, then I‚Äôd like to welcome you to explore with me the topic of writing and publishing posts üòá

### The original intent ü§©

Initially I was hoping to publish one post every week. I see the value in predicable posting schedule. But I don‚Äôt want to post low quality work just because I promised ‚Äúsomething‚Äôs coming every week‚Äù.  There‚Äôs clearly a conflict between consistent schedule and perfectionism. Out of that chaotic spectrum I decided there were two main criteria I wanted to focus on:

1. Consistent effort, not consistent results
2. Posts of high quality by my own definition

Both of these were attempts to solve the main potential problems I identified.  I‚Äôll elaborate on them and how I think those points help solve them.

### Effort üí™ vs results üìö

I understand ‚Äúschedule‚Äù as ‚Äúconsistent results‚Äù. A post every week is a good goal to aim for in my opinion. I enjoy watching Yahtzee Croshaw‚Äôs work, and that guy keeps a weekly or bi-weekly schedule for his videos. He‚Äôs remarkably consistent about it too! His flagship game review series called ‚ÄúZero Punctuation‚Äù has been running consistently for 13 years now. With very few breaks. I‚Äôm inspired by that, and I would definitely want to explore that kind of schedule in the future. But it collides heavily with my writing output. I can‚Äôt control the output at the start. But I can control my input - how much time I spend writing and the effort I put into it.

On July 27th I‚Äôve committed to writing every day. By focusing on that consistent effort I hope to solve the following problems:
* my scarce experience in consistent writing
* getting discouraged by the ‚Äúblank page‚Äù
* avoiding difficult topics

The first two issues seem tightly coupled to me.  Writing more often will improve my writing, at least to a point.  I‚Äôm following the [pottery class parable](https://aliabdaal.com/pottery/) here, that you might be familiar with.

I found that starting writing is the most difficult obstacle for me to jump over. A piece of advice that helped me tremendously was to focus on ‚Äú[2 crappy pages per day](https://tim.blog/2013/12/09/the-ugly-new-york-times-bestseller-the-creative-process-in-action/)‚Äù, courtesy of Tim Ferriss. I don't write as a full time profession, so I adjusted it a bit, but the principles are the same. My current version is to write "10 words per day‚Äù. It's enough for me to start. I write more if I want to and have the time. And that's usually the case.

The last problem seems unrelated.  But I think focusing on consistent effort is instrumental in solving it.  Some topics are easy for me to think about. I can write and publish a full post on them in about 2 hours. Those were the first topics I‚Äôve taken to write about on this blog. But not everything was this easy. Other posts take 15 hours and 6 editing passes spread across 3 months of writing, stewing, splitting, editing and rewriting. And if Tim Urban‚Äôs ‚Äú[Wait but why](https://waitbutwhy.com/)‚Äù is any indication, [some topics require years of writing](https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/08/story-of-us.html). With my current level of writing ability and intuition I don‚Äôt know whether a topic I pick is easy or difficult. **I realise it when 2-3 hours into writing, instead of writing one complete post, I've actually scratched the surface of of 4 different topics.**. At that point there are two choices. Either take the time to research and explore the topic fully or focus on writing something short about a small part of it. With a weekly or bi-weekly schedule the longer exploration cannot be given a chance.

At this point I don't want to give up the option of a deeper dive into an interesting topic. That‚Äôs why I choose to focus on writing every day and giving topics more time.

Potential problems/risks resulting from this solution:
* long times between posts

### Quality

I‚Äôve decided to publish a post as soon as it‚Äôs ready. Answering what ‚Äúready‚Äù means is a bit more tricky.  Problems I hope to solve:
* publishing low quality posts
* keeping perfectionism at bay

Editing takes more time than writing during the writing process. It‚Äôs also open-ended  - there is no natural upper limit to the time you could spend rereading and editing a post, other than the heat death of the universe or your own departure from this world. The door‚Äôs left ajar, letting perfectionism creep in.  There‚Äôs a well known quote in the writing world:

‚ÄúIf I had more time I would have written a shorter letter‚Äù ‚Äî Mark Twain*

The post / book / movie / game can be really good right now, but it will definitely be better, if we spend 2 more years on it. It‚Äôs what I call the Duke Nukem Forever syndrome.

In trying to avoid the abyss of endless refinement, setting a release date or a schedule. I already said why I won‚Äôt do that now. But that leaves this problem unsolved.

<**The SOUP**>

These are one more issue I want to be mindful of


With a weekly or bi-weekly schedule there are two choices at that point.


Let me reiterate - I‚Äôm doing this in my spare time.  I don‚Äôt want to publish something I think is a waste of your time as a reader, just to keep a schedule. So there won‚Äôt be ‚Äúnew post every Tuesday‚Äù or any other arbitrary schedule. When I have written something I consider worth your while, then it‚Äôll get published.


When I stared the blog, I was hoping for a weekly posting schedule.


I had misgivings about my own ability to write.

I'm aware perfectionist tendencies are running rampant among creatine types. Luckily I never considered myself to be creative. In web development here's a seemingly ubiquitous concept of cutting project scope to reach a Minimum Viable Product. How do you understand MVP blog post?

My definition comes down to topic choice and pleasant readability. Topic choice is fairly easy to me. I want topics I know enough about to be useful for you, the readers. I also want to feel strongly enough about a topic to push it past the finish line. It comes down to two types of topics:
* The ones I feel passionate about
* The ones I struggled with and managed to find a solution for

Pleasant readability is even more subjective. I write the outline in the first sitting. At that point I have a relatively good idea if the topic is worthy of a full post. Writing itself comes down to consistency. That's already described in the previous section. My current process of quality control after the post is written consists of reading the post 2-3 times after writing it and doing an editing pass after these readings. Granted, it relies heavily on my feels. But it works for now and I'll improve it along the way.

Potential problems/risks resulting from this solution:
* the lure of perfectionism
* long times between posts

### In conclusion

1. Consistent effort, not consistent results
2. Posts of high quality by my own definition

Both of these points are the opposite ends of the same spectrum. But if you look at it from another perspective, they point towards the same goal, but serve different functions. The consistent effort is a stabiliser. I want some writing done every day in order to get comfortable with the blank page and the process of writing. I want to move every day in the direction of publishing the next post. Those daily steps don‚Äôt have to be huge. But they need to be consistent.

I‚Äôm still enamoured with the idea of a schedule to keep perfectionism at bay. I will definitely explore that in the future. But first I want to have 6-12 months of daily writing experience under my belt. Focusing on consistent effort right now will be instrumental in helping me get it. I reserve the right to change my mind on the specifics, but the direction should be clear. I hope you enjoyed this dive into my thinking process on this. I hope it was helpful to you.

### Promise

Finally, I‚Äôd like to make a few promises I know I can keep:
* I will write every day. There might be a single day missed every now and then, but it [won‚Äôt happen 2 days in a row](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfLHTLQZ5nc).
* Every post you‚Äôll see appear on this blog will be thoroughly read many times to ensure it reads well and the quality will be as high as I can manage.
* I will fix all typos and language errors I can find. If you find any that I missed, please feel free to tell me at [contact@warpas.blog](mailto:contact@warpas.blog) or in the comments (**when they‚Äôre available**).

Thank you for reading ‚ù§Ô∏è
