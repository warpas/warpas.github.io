My posts don’t appear on a fixed schedule. There was close to a week between the first post and the second post. Then a bit over 2 weeks before the third post. Then the fourth post dropped 9 weeks after. What’s up with that?

 I didn’t want to commit to a schedule initially. My writing was  inconsistent and I didn’t want to make a promise I couldn’t keep. I published the first post **3 months ago**. Now I’ve got some ideas about how long writing a post can take. This post is my attempt at answering the following questions - “How often are the new posts going to appear on this blog? When can I expect the next post? ”

The short answer is “it depends”. I’m writing every day, in my spare time. When I have written something I consider worth your while, then it’ll get published.

If you’re interested in a longer answer, then I’d like to welcome you to explore with me the topic of writing and publishing posts 😇

### The original intent 🤩

“If I had more time I would have written a shorter letter” — Mark Twain

Initially I was hoping to publish one post every week. Some topics are easy for me to think about. I can write and publish a full post on them in about 2 hours. Those were the first topics I’ve taken to write about. But not everything was this easy. I’ve decided to publish a post as soon as it’s ready and I’m satisfied with it. But I had two criteria in mind:
1. I wanted consistent effort, not consistent results
2. I wanted posts that "read well" in my opinion.

<**The SOUP**>
Let me reiterate - I’m doing this in my spare time. On July 27th I’ve committed to writing every day. Others take 15 hours and 6 editing passes spread across 3 months of writing, stewing, splitting, editing and rewriting. I don’t want to publish something I think is a waste of your time as a reader, just to keep a schedule. So there won’t be “new post every Tuesday” or any other arbitrary schedule. When I have written something I consider worth your while, then it’ll get published.


When I stared the blog, I was hoping for a weekly posting schedule.

### Effort vs results

### Quality

I'm aware perfectionist tendencies are running rampant among creatine types. Luckily I never considered myself to be creative. In web development here's a seemingly ubiquitous concept of cutting project scope to reach a Minimum Viable Product. How do you understand MVP blog post?

My definition comes down to topic choice and pleasant readability. Topic choice is fairly easy to me. I want topics I know enough about to be useful for you, the readers. I also want to feel strongly enough about a topic to push it past the finish line. It comes down to two types of topics:
* The ones I feel passionate about
* The ones I struggled with and managed to find a solution for

Pleasant readability is even more subjective. I write the outline in the first sitting. At that point I have a relatively good idea if the topic is worthy of a full post. Writing itself comes down to consistency. That's already described in the previous section. My current process of quality control after the post is written consists of reading the post 2-3 times after writing it and doing an editing pass after these readings. Granted, it relies heavily on my feels. But it works for now and I'll improve it along the way.


### Promise

And I’d like to make a few promises I can keep.
