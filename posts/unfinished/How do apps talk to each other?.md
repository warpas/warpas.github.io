How often do you think about alternate methods of using your favourite phone app? There are many ways to interact with computer systems.  I‚Äôd like to expose you to one particular method, that most non-programmers don‚Äôt usually think about. It happens to be potent in making apps even more useful. I‚Äôm talking, of course, about APIs.

What are those? Well, do I have a treat for you today!

### The human-friendly ways

You‚Äôve seen visual User Interfaces hundreds of times. One of the simplest example of an UIs is the front page of Google Search.

![](How%20do%20apps%20talk%20to%20each%20other?/google_ui.png)

Just type what you want to find, press ‚ÄúEnter‚Äù or click one of two buttons.

<THIS IS THE PROGRESS OF THE CURRENT **EDITING PASS**>

Some common characteristics of web UIs are:
* Main design goal - They strive for simplicity - they are designed to be as easy to learn as possible so you could figure out how to use them on your own
* You interact with this type of interface primarily with touch screens, mouse and keyboard. Usually in that order of importance.
* The interface responds visually - it redirects you, draws something, flashes or throws a spinner on the screen to ease wait time

The same set of design principles applies to GUIs - graphical user interfaces. You know - your Windows, Mac or Linux applications. And, in many ways, to phone and tablet apps.

-Your interactions with them come down mostly to clicking, swiping or using the keyboard to type a bit, drag-and-drop elements around and to push buttons on the screen.-

Let‚Äôs just say the more useful a program tries to be, the more complex the UI gets. Finding a set of daunting examples is, as always, just one Google Search away. I found [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/computers/comments/71pcgm/post_software_with_the_most_complicated_ui/), but that‚Äôs only the tip of the iceberg. You might have come across something like the Blender image below.

Those interfaces are not pretty, but  they get the job done. The more features they brag about, the longer you have to spend on tutorials to know your way around the application.

But fear not! Interfaces can have an even more simplistic look and at the same time be even harder to use for the uninitiated.  I‚Äôm talking, of course, about CLI.

Command Line Interface. Anyone who tried to learn programming probably came across this beast at some point. I‚Äôm fairly sure it made a bad first impression.

This example is the folder view in Finder. I‚Äôm sure you know what it would look like on Windows. The same thing looks like this in the command line:

Some common characteristics of CLIs are:
* Main design goal - They strive to be fast, powerful and all that with the fewest possible inputs. The price to pay is - they have a considerably steeper learning curve initially.
* You interact with this type of interface almost exclusively with the keyboard. You can use the mouse but make no mistake - that‚Äôs definitely the secondary input device with a CLI.
* The interface responds with text. Luckily the text can have some colour to it and nowadays emojis are also usable ü•≥

The simplicity of the Command Line Interface comes from the input method - the keyboard. You can be sure that any type of interaction from the user in that wretched system will be text-based. The only way to interact with it is to just type out commands you want to run. It‚Äôs simple if you know the command you want to run. It‚Äôs UX hell if you don‚Äôt know them.

It does show a very important point though - computers translate your clicks, swipes and button presses to some sort of text, that gets further translated to machine language - ones and zeroes. Whether you type commands using a CLI or click around your windows the results are the same. A command for renaming a file (use an image file)
`mv tumbleweed.gif tumble.gif`
does essentially the same thing as clicking Rename and using `tumble.gif` as the new file name.

CLI used to be the default way to interact with the computer before Windows existed.  It has a higher bar to entry than the UIs of today. Using command line programs required you to at least glance at the documentation or simply ‚ÄúRTFM‚Äù. I‚Äôm far from teaching you how to use a CLI. The key takeaway here is for you to know something like that exists under the proverbial hood.

### Interfaces on the Internet!

You know how to use Google search. Maybe you don‚Äôt use search parameters that often (‚Äúkotlin site:blog.duolingo.com‚Äù) but that‚Äôs a bit too close to CLI territory. You know your way around the web. You can comfortably click/swipe through Wikipedia, Youtube, Facebook, Pinterest, Discord, TikTok or your other favourite web applications. Did you know you can also use the features of these sites without having to visit them or have their apps installed? You could just write a tiny script that does something for you.

Were you ever in a situation when you wanted to buy tickets to a concert and refreshed the page over and over again in order to get the tickets before they‚Äôre all sold out? That‚Äôs what a script could do for you. It‚Äôs a bit crude, because the script you write technically tries to imitate human behaviour controlling the computer‚Äôs input methods. It can enter text or click on things. Here‚Äôs a 20 second bit demo of a program doing that, if you‚Äôre interested - [Al Sweigart‚Äôs MS Paint demo - Switch to a Youtube embed!!!!!!](https://youtu.be/dZLyfbSQPXI?t=1050).

But there are ways to write scripts that can do much more meaningful actions than clicking or using the keyboard. You can write a script that adds an event to your calendar. It doesn‚Äôt have to click around the Google Calendar UI <[Youtube video on how to add it manually - Switch to a Youtube embed!!!!!](https://youtu.be/s8APbxFVF2I)> It can do it with just one command<Add this command here in some form>. This is where the aforementioned API comes in.

### Apps can talk to each other

Imagine you use Google Calendar to schedule a few video calls for work, and later you need to count the time you spent on those calls and use the total hour count in a monthly invoice that you keep the template for in Google Sheets. You could manually count those hours up . You could then fill your invoice template and be done with it. Done for this month. Then do that again next month. And so on, for every month for the foreseeable future‚Ä¶

There‚Äôs also another way. These apps can talk to each other for you. Computers are great at boring, repeatable tasks. You could have a simple script ask Google Calendar about those events on your behalf. Then it would calculate the hours you need for your invoice. Then send the data to Google Sheets, to the exact template you want. Once you have that script, all you have to do is run it once every month. That could be automated as well.

What I wanted to illustrate with that example is that many of the web applications you use every month can talk to one another. More specifically - you can make them send specific messages between them.  Messages like these:
* ‚ÄúHey Google Calendar, create a calendar event corresponding with this Toggl time entry‚Äù.
* ‚ÄúHey Twitter, I want you to post on my behalf whenever I publish a video on Youtube‚Äù
* ‚ÄúHey Trello, I want you to create a card in my project whenever I get the email newsletter from my favourite source‚Äù.

The only requirement an application has to fulfil to participate in that conversation is to provide, what nerds call, ‚Äúan API‚Äù.

### So what are those APIs?

The shortcut stands for Application Programming Interface. You already know what some interfaces are. This one‚Äôs for programming. You could understand it as sending messages to the application directly. Communicating with an application through an API is a bit different to the UI. It‚Äôs more precise but more difficult to read for humans. Take a look!

![](How%20do%20apps%20talk%20to%20each%20other?/google_api.png)

Those messages aren‚Äôt pretty. To the untrained eye it‚Äôs far from understandable English sentences and closer to math equations or even random strings of characters with some English words thrown in for giggles. At least at the first glance. But I bet you could understand parts of it. What do you think it does? What service does it access? What did the service respond with? What can you deduce from the URL in the green box? Please take 10-15 seconds to think about it.

There are two messages here:
* The request I sent - in the green box
* The response from the API - in the blue

The exchange in the example above shows a ‚ÄúSeattle‚Äù query to Google Search. The response you get depends on the request you send. Without any prior knowledge it‚Äôs difficult to guess what request you should send to get the desired response.

Luckily with popular APIs you don‚Äôt have to guess. The example above is based on instructions from [Google‚Äôs developer docs](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/using_rest#making_a_request). The documentation specifies what you can expect. ‚ÄúClick here to get the API key‚Äù, ‚Äúsend us your key and the search query term and we‚Äôll send you the query result in JSON format‚Äù.

API is a precise way of communicating. Once you figure out how a particular API endpoint works, you can rely on it to give you a predictable response. And if you get lost you can always read the docs or rely on trial and error.

### In conclusion

You don‚Äôt need to be a programmer to take advantage of APIs. There are plenty of programmers who have already written scripts for most of the use cases that interest you. And you can use a lot of existing APIs on you phone with the Shortcuts app (iOS) or Action Blocks (Android). But using APIs by non-programmers is a topic for another time.

There is a different, much more important reason why I took so long talking about APIs today. The model of communication the APIs use (doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs REST or GraphQL) is an accurate metaphorical way of thinking about communication between people. It‚Äôs a fascinating topic and I can‚Äôt wait to talk about it in detail next time! Thank you for reading! ‚ù§Ô∏è
