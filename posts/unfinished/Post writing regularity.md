# Post writing regularity
#post/in_progress

Initially I was hoping to publish one post every week. But I had two criteria for these posts in mind:
1. I wanted consistent effort, not consistent results
2. I wanted posts that "read well" in my opinion.

### Effort vs results

### Quality

I'm aware perfectionist tendencies are running rampant among creatine types. Luckily I never considered myself to be creative. In web development here's a seemingly ubiquitous concept of cutting project scope to reach a Minimum Viable Product. How do you understand MVP blog post?

My definition comes down to topic choice and pleasant readability. Topic choice is fairly easy to me. I want topics I know enough about to be useful for you, the readers. I also want to feel strongly enough about a topic to push it past the finish line. It comes down to two types of topics:
* The ones I feel passionate about
* The ones I struggled with and managed to find a solution for

Pleasant readability is even more subjective. I write the outline in the first sitting. At that point I have a relatively good idea if the topic is worthy of a full post. Writing itself comes down to consistency. That's already described in the previous section. My current process of quality control after the post is written consists of reading the post 2-3 times after writing it and doing an editing pass after these readings. Granted, it relies heavily on my feels. But it works for now and I'll improve it along the way.
