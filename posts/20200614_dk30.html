      <p>
        Do you like to talk to people about your exciting new idea and then never do anything about it? I’m certainly guilty of that.

      <p>
        Do you like to make promises that have a deadline attached to them? I try to avoid doing that, because I don’t like to disappoint.
      </p>

      <p>
        Would you promise someone to complete a long project that you don’t have the time for, and then commit to a deadline? I have been sure to avoid that for most of my adult life!
      </p>

      <p>
        I don’t think I have a healthy relationship with deadlines. I took everything I liked out of the mountains of productivity advice. I didn’t like introducing accountability into my life voluntarily. But that’s a story for another time. Something changed recently and I went out of my way to commit publicly to working on one of my side projects. I joined a DK30 event and promised to work on a side-project for the following 30 days.

      <h3>What is DK30?</h3>

      <p>
        Seth Godin wrote 10 years ago about the <a href="https://seths.blog/2010/10/heroes-and-mentors/">importance of heroes over mentors</a>. I have a sizeable list of people I look up to and consider my heroes. One of the first people to land on that list is a guy called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Plott">Sean Plott</a>. If you’ve ever been interested in the esports scene for Starcraft 2, chances are you’ve heard his online nickname - “Day[9]”. He’s been a caster/commentator for the game, well known for his positivity. Nowadays he <a href="https://day9.tv/">streams various games</a> and spins off quirky side-projects. One of those projects is <a href="https://day9.tv/dk30-about">the website for DayKnight 30 day projects</a> - DK30 for short.
      </p>

      <p>
        I came across that site at a fortunate point in time. I’ve already described how I started working on my side-project in an <a href="https://warpas.github.io/20200520_post.html">earlier post</a>. I’ve joined DK30 some 2 weeks after starting and my DK30 project was to keep up the commits for the next 30 days. I wanted to document my progress every day to keep up my initial excitement. I ended up doing it as planned. Some days were awesome - I sat down to do 1 commit and ended up pulled into interesting parts of the project and working for 1-2 hours with useful results at the end. Some other days were the opposite - all I did was add a couple of lines to the Readme file. But the goal was to do something, anything every day. If you’re interested, the whole project with short daily updates is described <a href="https://day9.tv/dk30/project/5ea88325015a1b2db108d0ef">here</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>What was the result?</h3>

      <p>
        These DK30 events are designed to be that little extra push for you to get started on a project you care about but never seem to find the time for. It was the first time I heard about it and I’m honestly surprised by the results.  The whole experience was engaging and surprisingly effective from my perspective. It even had a twist I would have never expected.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the end of the DK30 Quarantine Edition, Sean sat down to review a few of the projects from the event on his stream. I was stunned to see that he picked my project as an example and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImKcgkl_g2s&feature=youtu.be&t=803">discussed it for about 2,5 minutes</a>. I had a little fanboy moment and received good feedback from it.

      <p>
        If you’re on the fence about working on a project you care about but never seem to find the time, try the following. Cut the scope down as much as you can. If it’s a 6-month project, how about finding a part of it that could be done in a week? My DK30 project was about consistency. Doing small, incremental parts over 30 days. Would that work for you? If you have an idea and need that extra push, you don’t need a big event to start. The “<a href="https://day9.tv/dk30/project/new">New project</a>” button is right there on the DK30 page for you to use.
